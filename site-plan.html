      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Hello, have you ever wanted to tell a story or an idea? How about
        showing off a talent or advertising a business? You may be surprised to
        know that a website is one of the best ways to do this. I have good news
        with you. Websites are not something only the technical elites or uber
        wealthy have. Now let me share some great news with you. I want to make
        a site for you! I have a site plan that will showcase general
        information about me, professional aptitude, and some very impressive
        hobbies and talents of mine. This will allow you to get a feel for some
        options available to you. Take this as a template or customize it to
        your liking. This website can present anything you desire. Let me know
        what you want and we can make it happen. Do you have a card?
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        This audience is the greatest audience of all time. They are the
        entrepreneurs, the fashionable, and the bold. The age range will target
        young adult to middle age. It focuses on the kid at heart. One of the
        key features of this site is the resume and professionally seeking.
        Those in the same field as mine (CIT, Programming, Web Dev, etc.) will
        find this site particularly attractive. These services are inclusive to
        all. This site has something for everyone.

        Welcome to the Home Page! Let's talk about what we can do and have here.
        The best way to do that is to talk about me! Remember that pitch I gave
        you earlier? This is the prototype of the aforementioned prototype.
        Think of this as a model for a building. For these three pages I will be
        highlighting my works, passion for machine-dance games, and an
        exhibition of awesome website features. Those pages can be navigated via
        the the top navigation bar. See what happens when you hover over the
        navigation titles. Please take a look around and explore. You can find
        the links to my social media profiles on the next page or at the bottom
        of each page.
      </p>
      <h1>Professional Joseph</h1>
      <p>
        This page focuses on my professional side. Here you will find links to
        my résumé, digital portfolios, and projects. My professional focus is
        general skills aquistion in the field of computers and technology. I am
        currently studying the Applied Science major at Brigham Young University
        - Idaho. By the end of 2022, I will have my BS in Applied Science -
        CIT/WDD and three technical skills certificates. Those certificates
        include computer programming and support as well as an advanced
        Certificate in System Administration.

        Named after a rhythm game's artwork theme, the Digi-Groove Controller
        allows the user to play machine-dancing with their hands instead of just
        their feet.
        <!--<li></li>-->

      <h3>The Story</h3>
      <p>
        Back in 2015, I saw the coolest arcade cabinet. It was a rhythm dance
        game called "Digi-Groove." What made it so awesome was that you could
        play with hands instead of feet! I fell for it, and spent a lot of time
        and quarters there. I liked it so much that I decided I wanted one too.
        So I built one.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was quite the process. Not knowing much about what to do, I recruited
        friends and professionals who knew something about hardware and
        software. With the help of two dear friends, we created two "Digi-Groove
        Controllers". These were far more portable than a cabinet and really
        helped cut down the building costs.
      </p>
